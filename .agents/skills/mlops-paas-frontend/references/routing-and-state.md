# Routing and state

## Route conventions

- Routes are lazy-loaded in the app router.
- The URL is the durable source for selected project, job, build, run, version, and active detail tab.
- localStorage may be fallback state, not a replacement for route identity.
- Coordinators render nested pages through `Outlet` and provide a typed Outlet context.
- Child pages do not duplicate coordinator queries or lifecycle state.

## Current coordinated workflows

- Upload: Metadata → Build Model → Deploy Model.
- Training creation: Metadata → Source → Execution.
- Training detail: overview, logs, metrics, artifacts, and config nested routes.
- Registry/version detail and drift report routes load the exact UUID in the URL.

## Navigation rules

- Back/step navigation uses the same validation and persistence rules as footer actions.
- Dirty local files/forms use SPA blocking plus a confirmation modal; `beforeunload` covers refresh/close.
- Direct URLs missing required IDs must route to the earliest recoverable step.
- Do not use component-local tab state when the route represents the tab.
